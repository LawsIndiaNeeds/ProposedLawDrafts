.
(7.2) If a parent comes to cancel his Approvals, Patwari will cancel one of more of his approvals without any fee. Cancellations will also come on CM’s website.
.
(7.3) comment : to explain approval – (i) The voter can approve anyday, and there is no time limit. And different voters can file approval anyday they like – not necessarily on same day or during any specific time interval. (ii) say a voter approves candidates A , B and C. Then approval counts of A, B and C will increase by 1. (iii) now anyday, voter may cancel any of the approval he has filed. Say he cancels approval of C. Then approval count of C will decrease by 1 and approval count of A and B will remain unchanged (iv) the voter can also approve any other candidate anyday. Say he approves D, in which case, approval count of D will increase by 1, and approval count of A and B will remain unchanged

(7.5) CM may create a system which gives SMS notification to citizen on candidates he approved.
.
(7.5.a) comment : SMS mentioned above can be similar to SMS one gets when he makes a credit card transaction. So if someone is impostering a voter, then voter will come to know immediately and can work to register complaint. Also, finger print and photo will reduce the chance of impostering.
 
(7.6) CM may provide equipment to Patwari to capture photo and finger print of citizen, and can give receipt with the citizen’s finger print and photo. 
.
(7.7) CM may create a system where in citizen can submit/change his approvals over ATM type machines placed at Patwari office, or via SMS from registered mobile or via internet or via mobile phone apps. CM will decide the charges. CM may work with banks to enable citizens to register approvals via existing ATMs).
.
(7.8) Approval filing is open and public i.e. each voter’s approval of candidates will come on CM’s website in a way anyone in world can see 
.
(7.9) An approval filed by citizen will remain valid till citizen changes approval or citizen’s name is removed from voter list. So approval count of candidate will increase when a citizen approves and will decrease only when a citizen cancels approval or citizen’s name is removed from voter list.
.
(8) Condition for replacement of DEO : if
.
(8.1) a replacement candidate gets approval count over 35% of all (35% of ALL) parents in District AND
.
(8.2) his approval count is 2% (2% of all parents) more than approval count of existing DEO AND
.
(8.3) his approval count is highest of all
.
then, and then only, CM may or need not, remove existing DEO and appoint that candidate as the DEO.
.
(9) comment : 
.
(9.1) The “35%” and “2%” mentioned in clause above is “35% and 2% of all parents in the parent list” respectively. e.g. if a district has say 20 lakh parents, then 35% and 2% would mean 700,000 and 40,000 respectively regardless of number of parents who have filed approval.  And all three conditions, (8.1) , (8.2) and (8.3) should be fulfilled.
.
(9.2) Example - 1: Say a District has 20,00,000 parents. Say existing DEO has approval of say 500,000 parents. Then if one candidate has approval of 35% of 20,00,000 = 700,000 parents, then CM may or need not appoint him as DEO. 
.
(9.3) Example - 2 : Say District has 20,00,000 parents. And say existing DEO has approval of say 800,000 parents. Then a candidate must have approval of (800,000 + 2% of 20,00,000) = (800,000 + 40,000) = 840,000 to for CM to appoint him as DEO. 
.
(10) One person can become DEO of upto 5 districts in a State and upto 15 Districts across India. If he has become DEO via approvals of parents i.e. in each district he has approval of over 35% of all parents, then his salary and perks will be proportional to number of district he is DEO of. E.g. if he is DEO of say 7 districts in India, and he has approval of over 35% parents in 5 districts, then his salary will be five times the salary of DEO. But if a person is DEO of say 5 districts and in each District he has approval of less than 35% parents in 4 or all 5 districts, then his salary will be of one DEO only.
.
(11) Term limit : One person can be DEO of one District for atmost 8 years in a District in his lifetime. After that, he may become DEO of any other District or may serve on any other position in that District.
.
(12) No retirement benefits : if a person has become DEO via approval of parents, and is not part of Govt cadre, then he will not be eligible for any retirement benefits after his term ends due to term limit or expulsion. If any other law or resolution passed by District / State / India may provide him retirement benefits. But this law doesn’t create any provision of any retirement benefits.
.
(13) Salary of DEO brought in by approval of parents : Salary and perks of DEO brought in by approval of parents will be same as median salary of District Collectors in the Districts of the State irrespective of seniority and other considerations. DEO will not be eligible for any government housing or personal staff at home or government car or car driver, but he will get equivalent monetary amount. Decision of CM on this issue will be final. But all DEOs brought in by approvals of parents must get same salary from the State Government. And parents of District thru explicit majority may give additional salary to a DEO.
.
(14) How can CM appoint person approved by voters as DEO : The decision will be left to CM. CM may appoint him as OSD (OSD = Officer on Special Duty) and then appoint him as DEO. The decision of CM will be final 
.
(S) Suspension of RTR-DEO by people of State or of people of India
.
(S.1) The voters (all voters, not just parents) of a State can suspend this RTR DEO procedure in a District, for 4 years, using a procedure, established by CM. The procedure should show that explicit majority of ALL voters (not just voters who voted or said YES / NO) in the state have approved the suspension. And suspension can be extended by voters for 4 more years, several times.  
.
(S.2) The voters (all voters, not just parents) of India can suspend this RTR DEO procedure in a District or a State, for 4 years, using a procedure, established by PM. The procedure should show that explicit majority of ALL voters (not just voters who voted or said YES / NO) in India have approved the suspension. And suspension can be extended by voters for 4 more years, several times.
.
(S.3) comment : “S” stands for sovereignty. Any District level procedure can be suspended by explicit majority voters of State / India. And any State level procedure can be suspended by explicit majority voters of India. 
.
(RV) Non binding directive for Range Voting :
A few weeks or months after this law has passed, ECI may or need not allow voters to submit marks between (-100 to 100) for each candidate or just submit approvals. If voter is submitting approval and not marks, then no approval will mean 0 marks and approval will mean 100 marks. But if voter is giving marks, then actual marks given by him will be counted. The candidates total marks will be sum of all marks he got. And if  candidate has 1 or more marks from over 51% of all voters, then system will ignore all his negative marks. The total marks of sitting MP will be higher of the two ---- [ (votes he got * 67) , score he got after election ] . And recall poll will happen when a candidates score is (MP’s score + voter population * 100 / 10). And recall will happen as per clause-15. ECI may or need not  implement this clauses, only after over 51% of all voters of India has specified YES using clause-CV.2. This procedure is called as Range Voting, and it is immune to so called AUIT (= Arrow’s Useless Impossibility Theorem) . Range Voting is better than Approval Voting used here. 
.
(CV) Citizens’ Voice:
.
(CV.1) If any citizen residing anywhere in India wants any change in this law or has any complaint under this law, then he may submit an affidavit to DC’s designated clerk and clerk will scan the affidavit on put on CM’s website along with photo and details of the citizen. The clerk will charge Rs 30 per page. The clerk will issue serial number for the affidavit.
.
(CV.2) If any citizen residing in the area covered by the Patwari wants to register his YES / NO on the affidavit submitted in above clause, then he can go to Talati’s office and provide the serial number of the affidavit and his YES/NO on a form, and Patwari will enter his YES/NO for a fee for Rs 3 . The YES/NO shall come on CM’s website along with citizen’s voter-id, name, date etc
